# Realtime-Sign-Language-System
Technologies: 
1) Tensorflow
2) Python
3) OpenCV
4) LSTM Deep Learning Model

Key Features:

1) <text color="green"> Task </text>: Developed a model using Tensorflow and Python, which can
extract real-time video sequences, using OpenCV for Face and
Sign Matching. <br>
2) Action: This model can ease the method of communication, for those
people who are deaf, blind and dumb. <br>
3) Result: The extracted video sequences were used to train the model
using LSTM Deep Learning Model. <br>
